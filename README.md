<!DOCTYPE html>
Explanation: This line specifies the document type. It tells the browser that the document is an HTML5 document. It's important because it ensures that the browser renders the page correctly.
2. <html> ... </html>
Explanation: The <html> tag wraps all the content on the page. Everything between the opening <html> and closing </html> tags is considered the HTML content of the document.
3. <head> ... </head>
Explanation: The <head> tag contains metadata (data about the data) for the document, such as the page title, character set, external resources like stylesheets or JavaScript files, and more. The <head> section does not contain content that is directly visible on the page.
4. <meta charset="UTF-8">
Explanation: This line sets the character encoding for the document to UTF-8, which includes almost all characters from all written languages. It ensures that characters like special symbols and non-English letters are displayed correctly.
5. <title> ... </title>
Explanation: The content within the <title> tag sets the title of the web page. This title appears on the browser tab or window title bar when the page is opened. It is also used when bookmarking the page.
6. <body> ... </body>
Explanation: The <body> tag contains the actual content of the webpage, such as text, images, links, buttons, etc. Everything between the opening <body> and closing </body> tags is rendered as visible content on the web page.
